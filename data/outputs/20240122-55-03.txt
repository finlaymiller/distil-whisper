 Another one at 55. 1.2. 1.2. 1. 1.2. 1.2. 1. 2. 1. I'm going to be able to I'm going to be.

One is I could make stuff where I try to vary only along one dimension, like keep the rhythmic feel but change the notes or keep the harmonic feel and change the rhythmic feel, things like that. Grace notes, contours. small and bigger rhythmic feel changes. I could try to annotate those things. Maybe we can use the semi-supervised diffusion to classifier to learn and sort through some of this. Maybe. And this one, the harmonic stuff changed, quite a bit too. Oh, and also an important augmentation is to take pairs of things and put them together as loops in terms of like how to, like, so if there's a settlement A and segment B, then same times it can just go A, B, A, B, not just A, A, A, A, A, and get a loop that's twice as long.
