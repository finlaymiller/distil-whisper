 A bit of messing up in the last few seconds there. And different lengths of phrasing were happening this. I don't know if that's usable or not. There is a new one. Try it again. Messed up. Drag on. Drag on. I'm gonna be I'm going to be I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to you're going to I'm going to and you know and you're I'm going to be able to be I'm going to be I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to and you're going to and I'm going to I'm gonna you know I'm going to be able to you know I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to you're going to you know I'm going so I'm going and So here are the sloppy but the base was good and it was there's something kind of cool about the patterns or maybe still usable and not sure how to yeah
