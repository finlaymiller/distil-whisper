 A few comments about that last one. Some parts were better than others, so those could be marked. Also, it would be worth going through and finding the downbeat because I don't think I drop any beats, so it would be easy to check, listen on high speed to make sure, but might as well have a downbeat. And here's some more. And in some cases also like the base really needed what the right hand was doing, I think. And maybe so that maybe that could somehow be marked, even though knowing to be able to do the base on its own would also be helpful.
